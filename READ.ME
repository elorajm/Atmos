Team Project Information
Team Members	Elora Mathias, Bryan Stauch
Project Name	Weather Tracker - Atmos
Description of the Project	Atmos is an interactive web application that allows users to check current weather conditions and forecasts for any city. Users can search by city name to view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and short weather description. The app will use a weather API to fetch real-time data and store favorite locations in local storage. It will feature a clean, responsive layout and engaging visuals like weather icons and subtle animations for a smooth user experience. 
Target Audience of Web Application	Anyone who wants quick, easy access to accurate weather information, especially travelers, students and everyday users planning their day around weather conditions.
Features and Functionalities	Search bar to look up weather by city name
Fetches live data from a weather API
Displays temperature, description, humidity and wind speed
Option to “Save Favorite Cities” for easy access later
Drop-down to switch between °F and °C
Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
Animated background that changes based on weather conditions
Accessible design with labeled inputs and good color contrast
Project Requirements Questionnaire
What will the detailed form be used for? What other forms might you need?	The detailed form will be used for users to enter and submit a city name to search for weather data. Another simple form may allow users to add a custom nickname or notes for their saved favorite cities. Both forms will include input validation.
What data would you need to store in Local storage for persistence?	A list of the user’s favorite cities
Their temperature preference
The last city searched so it automatically reloads next time they open the app
What data will your app need? Is there an API or will you need to build your own dataset in a json file?	The app will use a live weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to pull weather data like temperature, humidity, and forecast details. A small backup JSON file may be created for offline testing with sample weather data.
Where would it make sense to use a drop-down menu or modal?	A drop-down menu will let users switch between °F and °C temperature units.
A modal window could display more detailed information such as a 5-day forecast or a quick “About” section explaining how to use the app.
Where are opportunities to use CSS Animations?	Background transitions that change based on weather.
Smooth fade-in effects when new weather results appear.
Animated icons for weather types.
Button hover effects and transitions for an interactive feel.
