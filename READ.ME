Atmos is a modern weather web application designed to provide users with a clean, responsive, and interactive experience. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate mastery of key front-end web development skills, including validated forms, API integration, responsive layouts, modular JavaScript, CSS animation, accessibility, and persistent data storage. The site allows users to search for real-time weather information using either a city name or ZIP code, and it displays current conditions, a 24-hour forecast, and a full 7-day outlook. All weather information is fetched from WeatherAPI.com, ensuring accurate and up-to-date results.

The application includes several important features that improve usability and engagement. Users can save favorite cities, which are stored in localStorage so they persist across sessions. A temperature unit toggle allows visitors to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and their preference is also saved. The site contains a fully validated contact form, complete with error handling and a confirmation message. Navigation includes a dropdown list for favorites, a detailed About page, and a dedicated Contact page. Every page is styled with a unified design system using CSS variables, spacing tokens, and consistent layout structure. Subtle animations, gradient effects, and fade-ins give the interface a polished feel.

Atmos also includes a small weather-themed game tucked into the site for users to discover on their own. Have fun finding it. The entire application is built using ES modules for organization, including separate files for API communication, UI rendering, localStorage helpers, and main application logic. The layout is responsive across desktop and mobile devices and follows accessibility best practices, including meaningful semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and readable contrast.

This project reflects strong understanding of the concepts taught throughout the course. It demonstrates practical skill in building a complete, functioning application from start to finish, including planning, implementation, debugging, and refinement. Through this work, we gained experience in structuring larger projects, improving user experience, and integrating external data sources. Atmos serves as a showcase of our collaborative effort and our ability to apply course topics in a real-world context.
